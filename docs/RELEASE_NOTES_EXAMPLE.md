## How It Works

The release notes are automatically generated by `scripts/generate-release-notes.ts` during the GitHub Actions release workflow:

1. **Commits Since Last Release:** Analyzes git commits between the previous tag and HEAD
2. **Conventional Commits:** Parses commit messages following conventional commit format
3. **Categorization:** Groups commits by type (feat, fix, docs, etc.)
4. **Formatting:** Creates markdown with emojis, commit links, and sections
5. **Installation:** Adds platform-specific download instructions

### Commit Message Format

To get the best release notes, use conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**

- `feat`: New feature (shows in ✨ Features)
- `fix`: Bug fix (shows in 🐛 Bug Fixes)
- `docs`: Documentation (shows in 📚 Documentation)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring (shows in ♻️ Refactoring)
- `test`: Tests (shows in ✅ Tests)
- `chore`: Maintenance (shows in 🔧 Chores)
- `BREAKING CHANGE`: Breaking change (shows in ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES)

**Examples:**

```bash
# Feature
git commit -m "feat(send): add support for custom AI tools"

# Bug fix
git commit -m "fix(status): handle empty session registry"

# Breaking change
git commit -m "feat(config)!: change config format to YAML"

# With scope and body
git commit -m "feat(ai-tools): add support for Cursor

Adds Cursor as a third AI tool option alongside OpenCode and Claude.
Includes integration tests and documentation."
```

### Manual Release Notes

If you want to add custom content to a release, you can:

1. Add it to the PR description - it will be included in the release notes
2. Edit the release notes on GitHub after creation
3. Use PR labels to control version bumping (major/minor/patch)

## Testing Locally

You can test the release notes generation locally:

```bash
TAG="v0.2.0" BUMP_TYPE="minor" PR_TITLE="Test release" \
  bun run scripts/generate-release-notes.ts

# View generated notes
cat /tmp/release-notes.md
```
